I'm not very familiar with code but I wanted to make my idea an AP so I made a manual (very simple, so please be nice, it's my first attempt at anything).

It's for the soccer game Fifa 98 (subtitled : "Road to the World Cup 98" but NOT "World Cup 98" that is another game), I used the PS1 version but the PC/N64/Saturn versions probably work (as very similar).
SNES and Sega Genesis versions works only in 1.00 (there are no day/night or stadium setting).
GB version is not compatible.

**How to play**
Play friendly games (difficulty and period lenght of your choice) with only teams (yours and opponents) from leagues unlocked under unlocked settings (stadium, difficulty, day/night, weather).
:warning:  The setting to change the difficulty is in "controller options" in the game for some reason

**Checks**
- Score goals (1 check per cumulative goal up to 50)
- Beat teams of different leagues (1 check per league)
- Win games under every setting unlocked (stadium, weather, difficulty, day/night)

**Items**
- 50 medals
- Unlock leagues (17)
- Unlock weathers (5)
- Unlock stadiums (17)
- Unlock day or night
- Unlock difficulties (3)

**Goal**
- Get 40 (out of 50) medals

**Notes**
I'm open to any changes or suggestions. I'd personally like to add an option to customize the number of medals/goals.
