**Archipelago Manual for Fifa : Road to the World Cup 98**

I'm not very familiar with code but I wanted to make my idea an AP so I made a manual (very simple, so please be nice, it's my first attempt at anything).

It's for the soccer game Fifa 98 (subtitled : "Road to the World Cup 98" but NOT "World Cup 98" that is another game), I used the PS1 version but the PC/N64/Saturn versions probably work (as very similar), and possibly others (as long as the same leagues are included, I didn't check SNES/GB/Sega Genesis versions).

**How to play**

Play friendly games (difficulty and period lenght of your choice) with only teams (yours and opponents) from leagues unlocked (you start with 1 random league unlocked)

**Checks**
- Score goals (1 check per cumulative goal up to 50)
- Beat teams of different leagues (1 checks per league)

**Items**
- 50 medals
- Unlock leagues (17 different leagues in the game)

**Goal**
- Get 50 medals

**Notes**
I'm open to any changes or suggestions. I'd personally like to add an option to customize the number of medals/goals.
